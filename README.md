iOS - GEO Location
You need to include NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription and NSLocationAlwaysAndWhenInUseUsageDescription in Info.plist to enable geolocation when using the app. If your app supports iOS 10 and earlier, the NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription key is also required. If these keys are not present in the Info.plist, authorization requests fail immediately and silently. Geolocation is enabled by default when you create a project with react-native init.

## In order to enable geolocation in the background, you need to include the 'NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription' key in Info.plist and add location as a background mode in the 'Capabilities' tab in Xcode.

  Go to the desired target of your app in Xcode, select the Build Phases tab, and add font files in the "Copy Bundle Resources" tab as shown below.
